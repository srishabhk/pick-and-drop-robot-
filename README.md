# pick-and-drop-robot-
A mobile-controlled pick-and-drop robotic system built as part of a robotics assignment. The project integrates Arduino-based control, a 3D-printed end effector, and a custom mobile interface for seamless operation.
Features
1.Arduino-powered control system for smooth actuation.
2.Mobile app interface for wireless control and movement
3.3D-printed end effector designed for precise gripping and object manipulation
4.Lightweight design for quick prototyping and testing

Tech Stack

1. Hardware: Arduino, DC motors/servos, Bluetooth module
2. Software: Arduino IDE (C/C++), Mobile app for control
3. Fabrication: 3D printing for custom end effector

How It Works

1 Commands are sent via a mobile app through Bluetooth.
2 Arduino processes the signals and controls the motors/servos.
3 The end effector grips/releases objects and performs pick-and-drop tasks.
